 * Step 12
The variables you have assigned have all had values that are numbers. JavaScript has multiple different data types. The next one you will use is the string. Strings are used to store things like words or text. Strings are surrounded with double quotes, single quotes, or backticks. Here is an example of declaring a variable with a string:

let developer = "Naomi";
Assign the inventory variable to have the value of stick.
